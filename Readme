Notes
  Variables
    - Address Size: ex 32 bit
    - Page Size
      Correlates to offset
      Given 4k page size, how many bits do you need to represent 4k bits uniqul
      4k = 4*1024 = 2^2 * 2^10 = 2^12 bits
      to represent 2^12 uniquely, you need log(2^12) bits = 12bits
    - PTE
      Correlets to the page table levels. in each page, there can be a PTE
      the PTE size is more than 1bit. 
      given a pte size, ex: 4bits.
      - how many unique 4 bits sections can u represent in page of size 4k?
        4k = 2^12
             ---- = 2^10
        4b = 2^2
      - to show 2^10 unique sections, you need 10 bits.
  

  8K = 8*1024 = 2^3*2^10 = 2^13
